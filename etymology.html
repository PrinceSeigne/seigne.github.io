			<p>From October 1st 2015. 6th grade</p>
			<p>My name is Pierce Conor Seigne, this name may not seem like anything special but there's quite some to it! My first name is Pierce which is english. It's not a really original name. It actually is derived from the name Piers which has no great significance. Then Pierces comes from Peter which means rock.</p>
			<p>My middle name: Conor is derived from the Irish name and King: Conchobar. Conchobar has an interesting backstory, he was known for his tragic desire for a goddess named Deirdre. Now finally my last name is Seigne (Pronounced Sing) which I couldn't find anything on it on search browsers so I just searched Seigneur I did this instead becasue when my sister did this unit a few years ago my she had done that instead of Seigne. I found some things out on it, such as it means Lord. We think it comes from France but the the real information source was my Dad (John Seigne) and Mother (Tricia Seigne). My Dad who gave the name to our family was born in Boston, his parents were Irish (which is one of the big reasons my middle name is Conor) and when he turned five years old he moved back to Ireland and would spend a long time there even until he graduated college and got his medical degree. He went to the United States in 1987 for work purposes and there he met my Mom who worked as a nurse at the time in a hospital. And from there they got married and had me my sister Siobhan and two brothers Colm and David.</p>
			<p>I don't think my parents knew any specifics on how interesting my name is.They named me Pierce ‚ÄúBecause there is nobody you can find who doesn't like that name‚Äù my Mom said. They named my middle name Conor mostly because my Dad is Irish and the name is related to Ireland and they wanted a ‚Äúfun‚Äù Irish name same goes for both my brothers and sister which are Taylor Talbot and Derek. And now I am the most glad to be a Seigne ever!</p>
